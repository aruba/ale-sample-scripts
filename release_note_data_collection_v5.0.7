Release Notes 
------------- 

Version
-------
data_collection_v5.0.7.sh

Release Date
------------
22/01/2019

Description
-----------
Up to version 5.0.6 if the VAR $start OR $end are empty, an error is returned via STDOUT as subtraction of empty variables is attempted.  As a result, the csv output file is not updated thus making it confusing for a user to understand why no value was written for the specified timestamp.

Solution
--------
Version data_collection_v5.0.7.sh checks if either $start or $end are NULL and if true, does not calculate the delta between $end and $start.  In the case $start is NULL, then the script will write "NULL" to the output file for the relevant timestamp.  If $start is not empty, the arithmetic operation should continue. The change also echoes to STDOUT that a NULL START or END date has be encountered so that users are informed.
